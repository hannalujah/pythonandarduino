Okay so

I want to connect arduino to python for a robotics project.
For this project I need to send random disturbance type (a number from 1 to 4) to the board (for 3 times each in every trial and then I need the board to act upon that random number 
and execute the disturbance type)

The codes uploaded here are the first step of the project in which I want to make sure that arduino is receiving the numbers and printing them correctly.
HOWEVER! the board does not receive the FIRST THREE NUMBERS sent to it.
So the code prints 0 for 3 times and then prints the rest of the numbers.
I think the issue has to do something with the timing but I don't know exactly what I should change. I've tried my best. 

I'll appreciate it if you could help me with this step of the project.
